(Note: The cheat-sheet generally shows Linux/macOS specific commands. For Windows, replace e.g. `_./gradlew build_` with just `_gradlew build_`, as the "." will lead to errors)

== Popular Gradle Commands

=== Running your build with a specific Java version

In addition to fumbling around with your `_JAVA_HOME_` env variable, do this:

1. `_gradle.properties_` in your project directory
+
[source,console]
----
// Note: Even on Windows, forward slashes only!!!

org.gradle.java.home=/path_to_jdk_directory
----

2. `_gradle.properties_` in the .gradle directory in your HOME_DIRECTORY
+
[source,console]
----
// Note: Even on Windows, forward slashes only!!!

org.gradle.java.home=/path_to_jdk_directory
----

=== Build a submodule

Instead of doing this:

[source,console]
----
cd myproject
cd mysubmodule
../gradlew.bat build
----

do:

[source,console]
----
cd myproject
./gradlew build -p mysubmodule

// or

./gradlew :mysubmodule:build
----

=== Build + Skipping Tests

Not `_-DskipTests_` ;)

[source,console]
----
./gradlew build -x test
----
=== Build Spring Boot Docker Image

[source,console]
----
./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=myorg/myapp
----

=== Upgrade Gradle Wrapper

[source,console]
----
// ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version {version}

./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.4
----

If that fails, e.g. the new Gradle version is incompatible with your project or your JDK version you will be stuck in an endless loop, because you won't be able to run the wrapper anymore.

You can then do a "hard-reset" by changing the Gradle wrapper version in this file:

[source,console]
----
yourprojectgradle\wrapper\gradle-wrapper.properties

## change the version number in the distributionUrl
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-bin.zip
----

== Gradle Concepts

== Gradle Pre-7 <-> Gradle >= 7 mapping

* `_compile_` <-> `_api_` (public, i.e. will become a transitive dependency for other modules) and `_implementation_` (private, other modules won't "see" the dependency)
* `_testCompile_` <-> `_testImplementation_`

== IntelliJ IDEA

Always refresh.

Never forget to click that button, after changing your `_build.gradle(.kts)_` file.

See section `_Version Properties_` here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/dependency-versions.html or all possible versions to override.

[source,groovy]
----
// in your build.gradle file
ext['jetty.version'] = '11.0.14'

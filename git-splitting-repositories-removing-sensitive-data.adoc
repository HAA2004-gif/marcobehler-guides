This website, or rather its many parts, live in a monolithic GitHub repository. I wanted to split out the guides (like the one you are reading right now) into their own public https://github.com/marcobehler/marcobehler-guides[GitHub repository].

At the same, I wanted to keep the rest private and somehow end up with a unified repository, where I directly "link" the public one, into the private one.

If you're curious about how to do that and also how to remove sensitive data from any Git repo, this post is for you.

== Splitting Repositories

Before you start, you'll need to install https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo[git-filter-repo], a handy Python script that lets you do all the things you never even knew you wanted to do with a Git repository.

Follow the https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/main/INSTALL.md[installation instructions] here, essentially you need to download the `_git-filter-repo_` Python script and put it somewhere on your `_$PATH_`.

Then, do a full, new clone of your repository and `_cd_` into it.

[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repository name}

cd {repository name}
----

In my case, I wanted to make one specific subfolder of this repository (`_marcobehler-guides/eins/zwei/drei_`) the ROOT for my new repository.

[plantuml, repo-v2, format=svg, opts="inline"]
----
skinparam Legend {
	BackgroundColor transparent
	BorderThickness 0
	FontSize 17
}

legend top left
marcobehler-guides
|_ eins
  |_ zwei
    |_ drei
      |_ git.adoc
      |_ spring.adoc
      |_ maven.adoc
end legend
----

The following command did the trick:

[source,console]
----
git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter {relative-folder-path}

// e.g. git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter marcobehler-guides/eins/zwei/drei
----

You'll end up with a new Git repository, that only contains the files from your specified subdirectory.

[plantuml, new-split-v2, format=svg, opts="inline"]
----
skinparam Legend {
	BackgroundColor transparent
	BorderThickness 0
	FontSize 17
}

legend top left
marcobehler-guides
|_ git.adoc
|_ spring.adoc
|_ maven.adoc
|_ ...
end legend
----

As a bonus, this command keeps the entire Git history for all those files!

[source,console]
----
git log

== Subtree Merges

Now that I had two repositories, I asked myself how I could link these two, i.e. end up with one unified repository. Or put another way: I wanted to include the _new_ repository into my _old_ repository.

[plantuml,subtree-merges-v2, format=svg, opts="inline"]
----
skinparam Legend {
	BackgroundColor transparent
	BorderThickness 0
	FontSize 17
}

' We use skinparams to hide our dummy participant
' and make it as little space as possible
skinparam SequenceLifeLineBorderThickness 0
skinparam SequenceLifeLineBorderColor transparent
skinparam SequenceParticipant {
	BackgroundColor transparent
	BorderColor transparent
	Shadowing false
	FontSize 0
	BorderThickness 0
	Padding 0
}
hide footbox

' "participant" nudges PlantUML to a sequence diagram

legend top left
marcobehlercom (old repo)
|_ some_folder
  |_ ...
|_ another_folder
  |_ ...
|_ marcobehler-guides (new repo)
  |_ git.adoc
  |_ spring.adoc
  |_ maven.adoc
end legend
----

There seem to be two choices for this:

* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[Git Submodules]
* https://gist.github.com/SKempin/b7857a6ff6bddb05717cc17a44091202[Git Subtrees]

I went down the Subtree path. If you have experiences with Submodules, please let me know in the comments. For subtrees, you'll want to execute these 3 steps:

1. Add the URL to your new repository as a remote to your (old) repository.
+
[source,console]
----
cd old-repository
git remote add -f {remote name} {url}
// e.g. git remote add -f marcobehler-guides https://github.com/marcobehler/marcobehler-guides.git
----

2. Make your old repository aware, that we (want to) merge possibly unrelated changes to it.
+
[source,console]
----
$ git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories {remote name + / + branch name}
// e.g. $ git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories marcobehler-guides/main
> Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
----

3. Copy the new repository's content into a subfolder of your old repository.
+
[source,console]
----
 git read-tree --prefix={relative subfolder path} -u {remote name}/{branch name}
 // e.g. git read-tree --prefix=marcobehle-guides/ -u marcobehler-guides/main
----

4. Tada! The files are now in your unified (old) repository.

Challenges with the subtree approach:

* If there are new changes in the public repo, you'll have to manually sync the changes.

[source, console]
----
git pull -s subtree {remote name} {branch name}

// e.g. git pull -s subtree marcobehler-guides main
----

* If you create a fresh clone of your unified repository in the future, you'll also have to go through the steps above again, e.g. add the remote etc.

Does anyone know any better ways for the syncing?

== Removing Sensitive Data

Along the way I noticed I wanted to remove a couple of files from my new repository and also remove any trace of these files/contents from the Git history. (It might even have been the case that a friend asked me how to get rid of a leaked credential in his repository )

While you can use `_git filter-repo_` above to do that job, I used https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/[BFG Repo-Cleaner], because it seems to be simpler and faster (the website claims 10-720x - who wouldn't [line-through]#need# want that for a single run ;) ).

`_bfg_` is a good, old Java program, so you'll need https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/a-guide-to-java-versions-and-features[to have a JDK installed]. Then simply download the `_.jar_` file and you can run it like so:

[source,console]
----
java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files {your relative file path with sensitive data}

//e.g. java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files mysubDir/passwords.txt
----

*Important note*: I erroneously assumed that `_BFG_` will delete the file starting from my current commit. Not so.

`_BFG_` will only delete the *history* of the file. Which means, you'll actually first need to remove (`_git rm_`) the file. Commit that change so it's gone. *Then* run `_BFG_` to clean up the history of the file.

Now there won't be any trace of your sensitive data left.

== Fin

That's all. I have the feeling I'll need another couple years to fully understand what Git, or rather tools like `_git filter-repo_` are capable of doing. It almost looks like a runner up to https://www.ffmpeg.org/[ffmpeg] in terms of complexity. So, stay tuned for more Git posts!

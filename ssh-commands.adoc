== SSH-Keygen

Nowadays, most platforms recommend you to generate keys with the ed25519 algorithm.

[source,console]
----
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
----

If you prefer to go with RSA for compatibility reasons, use the following:

[source,console]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"
----

The `_-C_` file simply puts a comment on your public key, like below, so you can e.g. easily make out which public key belongs to which email address, in a busy <<authorized_keys>> file.

[source,text]
----
ssh-ed25519 KLAJSDLKSAJKLSJD90182980p1+++ your@email.com
----

*Note*: When generating SSH keys, make sure to protect your private key with a passphrase.

== SSH with Keys

To use a specific private key to connect to a server, use:

[source,console]
----
ssh -i mykeyfile user@remotehost.com
----

Instead of specifying your key files manually with `_-i_`, use an <<ssh-agent>>.


[[authorized_keys]]
== Authorized_Keys

Any remote host or service, like GitHub, that you want to use your SSH keys with, needs the `_public key_` of your SSH keypair.

For servers, you simply need to append your public key to the file `_~/.ssh/authorized_keys_`.

Use one of the following commands to do that:

* `_cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh USER@HOST "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"_` - https://askubuntu.com/a/262074
* `_ssh-copy-id user@host_` - https://askubuntu.com/a/46427

With services like GitHub, AWS etc. you would either use the UI to upload your public key, or, if available, command-line tools.

== SCP

To upload a file to a remote server:

[source,console]
----
scp myfile.txt user@dest:/path
----

To recursively upload a local folder to a remote server:

[source,console]
----
scp -rp sourcedirectory user@dest:/path
----

To download a file from a remote server:

[source,console]
----
scp user@dest:/path/myfile.txt localpath
----

To recursively download a local folder to a remote server:

[source,console]
----
scp -rp user@dest:/remotedir localpath
----

*Hint*: When doing things recursively via SCP, you might want to consider rsync, which also runs over SSH and has https://serverfault.com/a/264606[a couple of advantages over SCP].

[line-through]#*Hint 2*: https://lwn.net/Articles/835962/[SCP has been deprecated] and you should consider switching to (the less user-friendly) SFTP.# https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32026913[The scp command uses the SFTP protocol since OpenSSH 9].

[[ssh-agent]]
== SSH-Agent

With a running OpenSSH agent (automatically available out of the box on most Linux distributions and macOS) simply use:

[source,console]
----
ssh-add privatekeyfile
----

To enable the OpenSSH agent on Windows, you'll need to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement[execute the following commands]:

[source,console]
----
# By default the ssh-agent service is disabled. Allow it to be manually started for the next step to work.
# Make sure you're running as an Administrator.
Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic

# Start the service
Start-Service ssh-agent
----

*Note*: On Windows/Linux adding a key to your ssh-agent once, even with a password, will make sure that the key gets associated with your 'login'. Meaning: When you restart your PC and log in again, you'll have your identity automatically available again.

To get the same behavior on macOS, you'll need to follow these instructions https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/250572[on StackExchange].


== SSH Config

Create a file  `_~/.ssh/config_` to manage your SSH hosts. Example:

[source,text]
----
Host dev-meta*
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/johnsnow.pem

Host dev-meta-facebook
    Hostname 192.168.178.1

Host dev-meta-whatsapp
    Hostname 192.168.178.2

Host api.google.com
    User googleUser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/targaryen.key
----

*Note*:

The `_Host_` directive can either

* be a pattern (matching multiple follow-up `_Hosts_`)
* refer to a made-up hostname (`_dev-facebook_`)
* be a real hostname.

If it's a made-up hostname, you'll need to specify an additional `_Hostname_` directive, otherwise, you can leave it out. And to add to the overall confusion, a `_Host_` line can actually contain multiple patterns.

With the config file above, you could do a:

[source,console]
----
ssh dev-meta-facebook
----

Which would effectively do a `_ssh -i ~/.ssh/johnsnow.pem  ec2-user@192.168.178.1_` for you.

For a full overview of all available options, look at https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/[this article].

== Git & Windows OpenSSH

To make Git use Window's OpenSSH (and not the one it bundles), execute the following command:

[source,console]
----
git config --global core.sshcommand "C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe"
----

== Exit Dead SSH Sessions

To kill an unresponsive SSH session, hit, subsequently.

[source,console]
----
Enter, ~, .
----

== Multiple GitHub Keypairs

Trying to clone different private GitHub repositories, which have different SSH keypairs associated with them, doesn't work out of the box.

Add this to your `_.ssh/config_` (this example assumes you have two GitHub keypairs, one for your work account and one for your personal account)

[source,console]
----
Host github-work.com
    Hostname github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_work

Host github-personal.com
    Hostname github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_personal
----

Then instead of cloning from `_github.com_`.

[source,console]
----
git clone git@github.com:marcobehlerjetbrains/buildpipelines.git
----

Clone from either `_github-work.com_` or `_github-personal.com_`.

[source,console]
----
git clone git@github-work.com:marcobehlerjetbrains/buildpipelines.git
----

== SSH Agent Forwarding

Ever wanted to use your local SSH keys on a remote server, without copying your keys to that server? For example to `_git clone_` a private repository via SSH on a remote server?

Agent forwarding to the rescue. Edit your local `_.ssh/config_` file like so:

[source,console]
----
Host yourremoteserver.com
    ForwardAgent yes
----

Then simply `_ssh_` to your server and execute an `_ssh-add -L`. The server's SSH agent should have all local SSH identities available and you can start cloning away!

== SSH Agent Forwarding: Windows to WSL

If you want to use the Windows OpenSSH agent with all its identities from WSL, do the following:

1. Install `_socat_`, e.g. on your WSL Distribution: e.g. `_apt install socat_` for Ubuntu/Debian.
2. Download a build of https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay/releases/tag/v0.1.0[npiperelay] and put it somewhere on your (Windows) PATH.
3. Put the following into your WSL `_~/.bash_profile_` or `_~/.bashrc_`.

[source,bash]
----
# Configure ssh forwarding
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$HOME/.ssh/agent.sock
# need `ps -ww` to get non-truncated command for matching
# use square brackets to generate a regex match for the process we want but that doesn't match the grep command running it!
ALREADY_RUNNING=$(ps -auxww | grep -q "[n]piperelay.exe -ei -s //./pipe/openssh-ssh-agent"; echo $?)
if [[ $ALREADY_RUNNING != "0" ]]; then
    if [[ -S $SSH_AUTH_SOCK ]]; then
        # not expecting the socket to exist as the forwarding command isn't running (http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/fto.html)
        echo "removing previous socket..."
        rm $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    fi
    echo "Starting SSH-Agent relay..."
    # setsid to force new session to keep running
    # set socat to listen on $SSH_AUTH_SOCK and forward to npiperelay which then forwards to openssh-ssh-agent on windows
    (setsid socat UNIX-LISTEN:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK,fork EXEC:"npiperelay.exe -ei -s //./pipe/openssh-ssh-agent",nofork &) >/dev/null 2>&1
fi
----

Enjoy!

Major thanks to Stuart Leeks, who I blatantly stole this code from - he did all the work @ https://stuartleeks.com/posts/wsl-ssh-key-forward-to-windows/.

Check out his https://wsl.tips/book[WSL Book] for more such tricks!

== SSH Tunnels

Want to connect to a server that is hidden from the outside world, but accessible from a box you have SSH access to? Like an Amazon RDS database, which is only reachable from inside an AWS network?

Use SSH forwarding

[source,console]
----
ssh username@jumphost -N -f -L localport:targethost:targetport
----

The following command establishes an SSH tunnel between my `_local machine (@port 3307)_` and an `_RDS database (@port 3306)_`, via an `_EC2 jump host (18.11.11.11)_`.

[source,console]
----
ssh ec2-user@18.11.11.11 -N -f -L 3307:marcotestme.12345.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306
----

You could now, for example, use the mysql client to connect to `_localhost:3307_`, which will be transparently tunneled to RDS for you.

[source,console]
----
mysql -h localhost -P 3307
----

*Note*: A lot of tools/IDEs like https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA], support opening up SSH tunnels by just clicking a checkbox in the UI.

== Password Managers & SSH Agents

Password Managers like https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/[1Password] or https://lechnology.com/software/keeagent/[Keepass] can not only store your SSH keys, but they also come with their own `_ssh-agent_`, replacing your system's ssh-agent.

This means, whenever you unlock your password manager on any machine that you have it installed on, you'll have all your SSH identities instantly available.

Super useful!

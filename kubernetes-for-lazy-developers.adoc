(*Editorâ€™s note*: At ~n words, you probably don't want to try reading this on a mobile device. Bookmark it and come back later.)

== Introduction

If you're a developer who has either never used Kubernetes before or wants to brush up on K8 knowledge so that your DevOps colleagues will be scared, this guide is for you.

TODO TODO

=== How did we get here?

Many devs don't care, where their stuff is being run.....

What does running actually mean? In case of Java, java -jar....ex. php / ruby

lowest common denominator..no matter how much technolgy you pour on top

=== Docker to the rescue?

someone told you buliding docker images is the right thing to do...explaion..pros / cons

depending on the programming language....Java ecosystem vs other ecosystems......highlight incompatibilities

=== What are benefits/drawbacks of the Docker approach?

note: cut, condense, simpliyfy

even though you'll immediately find plenty of people discussing potential version incompatibilities, java is unlike python or ruby

nenn mir EIN docker image das du OHNE ZU WISSEN WAS ES TUT einfach wo deployen kannst
du musst auf dockerhub die environment variables lesen
du mussst wissen welche volumes und shit du bereitstellen musst
es ist also nicht "doppelklick app.exe"

rl problem: too little reosurces, killing health-checks, oom, architects, etc.


=== What do we do with these Docker images?

Deploy them somewhere...but how? registry, running manual commands, docker compozzzzze

=== What do I need Kubernetes for, then?

orchestrator....run and manage docker containers..... what does managing containers mean

graphic...plantuml

=== Kubernetes 101: Control Pane

=== Kubernetes 102: Worker Nodes

=== Kubernetes 103: Management

pods
wie
run containers.....healthchecks...self healing....what does that even mean? ubuntu/upstart since the break of dawn: restart hanging processes

=== Why do I as a developer need to know this stuff?

=== How does Kubernetes do all this? YAML!

YAML, YAML, YAML...have a deployment...tell Kubernetes: Go.

== How can I apply this YAML file?

kubectl...

=== Kubectl primer

What is kubectl?

what can kubectl do? apply ? ssh? other stuff?

=== Meet kubeconfig file

kubectl works against a clste.r.....namepsaces..

=== Self-Healing: Lie

self healing: systemd oder supervisord

=== What else can Kubernetes do for me? Secrets Management

https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-kubernetes/docs/current/reference/html/

=== Don't these YAML files become a mess?

Kustomize / Helm Charts + IDE support



IntelliJ IDEA support

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/kubernetes.html  (IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate)

[link video]

=== what are helm charts...

=== what is kustomize?

=== What is Terraform?

=== DO I really need all of this?

cgroups....resources....limitation......real life -> 0,5 CPUS.....in development needing the latest macbook pro 64 gig

book reference....100s of applications ok...but what about 100thousands.....missing reference (anyone?)

Comparison with ansible.....puppet?

application servers vs kubernetes...

=== Framework Support

spring boot builds directly into docker image.....optimized .....

=== How does Kubernetes influence my local development?

=== How do I do local development with Kubernetes?

twitter poll

For Development...Docker compose.....

docker-compose files...and K8s manifest files...

clulster & skaffold

minikube....

testcontainers...

===  online hype stories && what ifs?????

strive a career in sales and marketing if you can plausibly explain where 5x the traffic will come from tomorrow....

online hype stories vs reality

=== moving complexity

reference kubernetes book...2016 devops...study...would like to have a closer look

100000 of books for Kubernetes...100s of pages to set up just networking

=== Fin

small workloads, vs . google sized workloads....while default seems to be k8, do you really NEED this stuff??

== Acknowledgments

Yet to come. Ssend in a PR btw if you don't like something
